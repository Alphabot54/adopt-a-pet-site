# adopt-a-pet-site
### Overview
This Node.js website is originally a project for my SOEN 287 course. It is a website that simulates a pet adoption center. It allows users to put their pets up for adoption and to browse through pets that are available for adoption.

### Features
Login: The user can log into and out of the site. If they don't have an account, they can create one! The data for username and passwords are stored in login.txt. 

Find a Pet: The user can use this to specify what type of pet they are looking for. The website will render a list of pets that match the chosen attributes / description. Note, the list of all the pets and their owner's information is found in availablePetInformation.txt.

Give a Pet: This allows a user to put one of their pets up for adoption. Once they have done this, they can see it when finding a pet. The site automatically assigns an image for their pet that fits the pet that they have described to give away.
